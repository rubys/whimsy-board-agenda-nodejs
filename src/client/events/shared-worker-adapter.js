//
// This adapter uses a shared worker to connect to the WebSocket, and
// BroadcastChannel to send events across browser windows.
// This approach is not universally implemented, most notably by Safari:
//
//   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker/SharedWorker#Browser_compatibility
//   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel#Browser_compatibility
//
// Down sides include neither shared workers nor broadcast channel having
// meaningful lifecycle events or even a manner of determining the number
// of active "clients" a given SharedWorker is servicing.
//
// At the moment, ESModule support is not widely supported, so SharedWorkers
// must effectively be self-contained; this means that there will be some
// duplication with other adapters.
